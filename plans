Peer assessment plan
Roles: documentor, coder, tester, designer
If each of us fulfil our roles, we each get exact mark.

1 documentor: UMLs
1 designer: GUIs
3 coders: Programming
everyone is tester at the end

Development plan
In the app_dev repo
Now we have 2 branches: Master, dev
We work on dev only, then later we merge it to master at the end of each sprint.
Each sprint is one week.
Leader will then send Master to Martin as a release.
